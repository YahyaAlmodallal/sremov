## Title: 
   A Scoping Review of Experimental Models in Oncolytic Virotherapy

## Rationale: 
   "A woman with mixed-celled leukaemia with greatly enlarged spleen. Two weeks after an attack of what was probably influenza, the leukocytes were found reduced from 367,070 to 7500 ... The spleen was much smaller; the liver became smaller later.[1]" 

The study of oncolytic viruses (OVs) has accelerated rapidly since the beginning of the twenty first century; it promises a specific, flexible, and capable weapon in the fight against cancer. Oncolytic virotherapy is a culmination of advancing knowledge in several scientific fields, including oncology, virology, genetics, pharmacology, among others. The knowledge breadth, however, also entails extensive consideration of numerous key points in the safety, efficacy, ethicality, applicability, and scalability of agents intended for the treatment of human diseases. 

With the shear scale of potential natural and engineered agents, and targets, pre-clinical experimental models (PEMs) are of essential interest to the field of oncolytic virotherapy. While in-vitro, ex-vivio, and in-vivo models have been known and used for over a century, new and more adaptive PEMs continue to emerge and become more widely available to evaluate potential treatment agents, including genetically engineered models (GEMs), patient-derided xenografts (PDXs), organoids, and computer models (i.e. in-silico models). Each particular PEM has specific applications, advantages, and limitations; and understating these is a fundamental piece 

The rationale of this study is to shed light on the PEMs that have been used in pre-clinical oncolytic virotherapy studies to date, 

The promise of a selective and capable therapy for neoplastic diseases continue to elude the scientific
