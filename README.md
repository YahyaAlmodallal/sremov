## Title: 
   A Scoping Review of Preclinical Models in Oncolytic Virotherapy

## Rationale: 
   "A woman with mixed-celled leukaemia with greatly enlarged spleen. Two weeks after an attack of what was probably influenza, the leukocytes were found reduced from 367,070 to 7500 ... The spleen was much smaller; the liver became smaller later.[1]" 

   The study of oncolytic viruses (OVs) has accelerated rapidly since the beginning of the twenty first century[2]; underscoring our growing recognition of their potential to provide more specific, adaptable, and effective tool cancer treatments. Oncolytic virotherapy integrates our advancing knowledge in several scientific disciplines, including oncology, virology, genetics, pharmacology, among others. The knowledge breadth, however, also entails extensive consideration of numerous key points in the safety, efficacy, ethicality, applicability, and scalability of agents intended for the treatment of human diseases. 

   With the sheer scale of potential agents and targets, pre-clinical models (PMs) are indispensable to the field of oncolytic virotherapy. These models, including the well known in-vitro and in-vivo models, and the more recent innovations in genetically engineered models (GEMs), patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), organoids, and computer "in-silico" models[3], offer vital insights into the behavior of OVs within complex biological systems. As the field of oncolytic virotherapy continues to evolve, it is imperative to address the challenges associated with the scalability of treatments, ethical considerations in clinical trials, and the broader applicability of these therapies. The ongoing exploration and refinement of pre-clinical models are fundamental to navigating these challenges, ensuring the meticulous planning, execution, and reporting of pre-clinical studies.[4].


## Objective
   This study aims to analyze and synthesize the body of pre-clinical research on oncolytic virotherapy, focusing on the utilization, effectiveness, and comprehensive assessment of various pre-clinical models (PMs). By examining their historical and current applications, this research seeks to illuminate trends, evaluate efficacy and safety profiles, and explore the biological relevance, ethical implications, and cost-efficiency of these models in the context of cancer research.
   
    Research question per SPICE format:
     Setting: Pre-clinical environments where oncolytic virotherapy research is conducted, encompassing both laboratory and controlled experimental setups.
     Population: Non-human subjects (such as animal models) and inanimate objects (like cell lines and organoids), as well as human-derived biological materials, to assess the utility and applicability of various PMs in simulating human cancer conditions.
     Intervention: Native virus and/or engineered virus, with or without other therapeutic interventions
     Comparison: The analysis will compare across a spectrum of pre-clinical experimental models, highlighting differences in model design, application, and outcomes. This comparison aims to identify the most effective models for specific research objectives and cancer types.
     Evaluation:
      -	Biological relevance: Assess how closely each model replicates the human cancer microenvironment, considering tumor biology and host interactions.
      -	Genetic fidelity: Examine the genetic congruence between the models and human cancers to evaluate their predictive value for human responses.
      -	Immune system representation: Analyze how well each model simulates human immune responses, including immune activation and suppression mechanisms.
      -	Cost, time and other resource requirements: Evaluate the financial and logistical aspects of using each model, considering affordability and accessibility for widespread research use.
      -	Scalability and throughput.
      -	Ethical and regulatory considerations.
      -	Drug delivery and pharmacokinetics: Effectiveness in simulating human pharmacokinetics and drug delivery routes.
      -	Model specific advantages and limitations noted in the article.
      - Applicability to Specific Cancer Types: Determine the suitability of each model for researching various cancer types, based on origin, growth characteristics, and treatment response profiles.
